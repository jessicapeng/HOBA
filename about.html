                <p id= "HOBAparagraph">HOBA stands for "Homeless Of the Bay Area," and is run by Lynteractors of the Community Project Commitee.With perfect weather and gracious support systems, it's no surprise that the state of California has the highest homeless population in the nation. Yet what many of the privileged, affluent people living in the Bay Area are not aware of is the astoundingly high rate of homelessness that is right around the corner. San Jose and Santa Clara County hold the nation's fifth-highest homeless population, with only huge metropolises such as New York City and Los Angeles ahead of San Jose. Homeless Stories of the Bay Area was created by six motivated students at Lynbrook High School to bring awareness to this concentrated issue, through sharing the stories, struggles and advice of the homeless. We hope that through reading the stories of these incredible individuals, you may feel better informed and inspired to take progressive action in your own means.</p>
