A few fines still to pay off with the county, but we’re working on it one piece at a time. My son is actually helping me with that. It’s been really good this last year and a half, which is how long I’ve been here. It’s allowed me to reconnect with family, to share my experiences with my family and educate them about what happened. Nowadays, spending time with my family makes me happiest. My son lives here in San Jose and he works downtown so I get to see him often. We had several years apart when I was homeless but we’re working on our relationship, just taking it day by day, appreciating the small things and holding onto them.
                            I try not to be a nitpicker with him--he works at a bar, so he’s around alcohol all the time. I try not to say be careful all the time. He knows because he’s seen what has happened. I’ve lost people in each generation to alcohol or drugs, and he’s seen it--from grandparents to parents to even brothers and sisters of mine.” (4/4)</h3>

You learn to have respect for other people’s boundaries and spaces by cleaning up after yourself and respecting those around you, being humble. But being homeless was scary. My first year I was homeless, I was attacked, and I was in the hospital for four days, and had lost my voice for about 2 weeks because they damaged my larynx. But it was an educational experience for me--I don’t trust people. I actually had a big fear of people until coming here. I didn’t want to be around anybody, which made my depression and drug alcohol abuse even worse because I was isolated from people. But coming here actually allowed me to open up, to work on talking to people, to get over fear. I still have a fear of people--I have a tendency to stutter a lot when I’m really nervous, but we’re working on it, and it’s gotten a lot better. It’s been an education, and it’s made me stronger. Even if I’m afraid of something, I’ll still try it--I’ll still put myself out there and try it anyways.” (2/4)</h3>

                            I was married for several years before it fell apart. My kid had already moved out, and I just gave up--my heart broke, pretty much. It started out with just drinking, and I still lived in a home for about 3 years, but in 2009 I became homeless and landed out here on the streets. My marriage fell apart because I flatlined. I wasn’t getting an education, I wasn’t growing in my job, I wasn’t growing in my community or in myself. It was all about the other person. When she walked out, I lost my identity. I’m working on that. It’s taken me since 2009 to become more independent and realize that I want to live.” (1/4)</h3>

I ended up losing my job. I went to jail, I lost my place of residence, lost my truck. I was on the streets for almost 3 weeks until I ran out of money, and everything else that I needed to survive. But there are a lot of good memories. We used to sit around the firehouse waiting on a call, playing pool, gossiping, working on the engine and making sure everything was in line. We’d clean the hoses and check the water pressure in the truck. It was always a fun time, and we’d play pranks on each other. It was like a family. As part of the job I went to Hurricane Katrina back when I was 18, in 2005. It was a really humbling experience.

My parents never argued, and I had a great upbringing–I never saw it coming, really. I never thought this would happen.
                            I’m surprised at how many people help with the homeless. There are a lot of churches that put meals on, and other organizations like that. Homelessness can become a way of life for people, especially here in the Bay Area where the weather’s really nice. With people serving meals all the time, and you being able to maybe fall asleep in the sleeping bag on the porch of the church, people just fall into it, and it’s hard for them to get out of it. The government doesn’t really help in getting people to stay out of homelessness.” (1/4)</h3>
